### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a self-taught Python Developer. I do my backend tasks in Python Django, and I build cutting-edge, test-driven, and highly scalable APIs using django rest framework and graphql. This can work on a variety of databases and frontend frameworks.. I'm familiar with Html, CSS, Bootstrap4, and mostly VueJS, a JavaScript framework on the front end.

Thanks for looking, and I hope we can work together soon..
